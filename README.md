# Austin, Texas Animal Center - Outcome Predictions

## Introduction:
Every year, 6.5 million animals enter a U.S. animal shelter, but what happens next? The city of Austin, TX provides shelter data on both animal intakes and outcomes— with that information, we’ll explore the underlying patterns and trends in the 11th largest city in America. 


## Data Questions:
1) What are the most common breeds that enter the shelter?
2) Does the shelter live up to it's claim of being 90% 'No Kill'?
3) Using the intakes data, is it possible to accurately predict whether or not an animal's outcome will be "Return to Owner"?
4) What intake data does the model find relevant and how does it use that information to make predictions?
