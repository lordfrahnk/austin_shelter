Every year, 6.5 million animals enter a U.S. animal shelter, but what happens next? The city of Austin, TX provides shelter data on both animal intakes and outcomes— with that information, we’ll explore the underlying patterns and trends in the 11th largest city in America. 

Using the intakes and outcomes datasets from the city of Austin, TX, I'll try to predict if an animal's outcome is likely to be "Return to Owner". 

The datasets can be found here:
